The project concerns the development of an application for receiving news headlines from news centers of different countries. The project is divided into two parts NewsAPI & NewsAPP which are about the construction of a library and the construction of an application for downloading data.

This repository concerns the second part of the project (Application) – NewsAPP and its use comes from pre-existing methods created in the library which has been constructed in the repository NewsAPI.  The user should not forget to transfer in the repository NewsAPI and enter his apikey and IP address according to the directions given in README.

With the Application, the user has access in a menu where can choose one or more from the existing choices (1a,1b,2a,2b,2c,2d,3,4) to get the results he wants. This is effective when the user runs the project and the menu is appeared on the console. Then, he can type any choice and the program brings him the results.

The application’s choices:
1a: brings results for a country 
1b: brings results for a category
2a: brings results for a query (specific word or phrase in the title or body of the news)
2b: brings results for a specific language
2c: brings results for a specific source of news
2d: brings results for a space of the user’s choice 
3: brings results according to the user’s IP address- here the user has to enter his https://ip-geolocation.whoisxmlapi.com/ apikey 
4: the user ends the program 

It is worth noting that the user always has clear directions about the parameters he has to enter in program through messages displayed on the console.
